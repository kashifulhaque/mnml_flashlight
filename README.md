**You can fork and redistribute this app as your own.**

You can download the app **[here.](http://bit.ly/mnmltorch)**


Task remaining:

- [x] Build a flashlight which serves its purpose.
- [ ] Make a widget so that you won't have to frantically search for the app when it's dark.
- [ ] Try to make a notification bar toggle. (If I become capable enough someday)
- [ ] Win hearts. :heart:
